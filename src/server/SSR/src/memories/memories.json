When I got into uni a few years back, I had told a few other friends who has said 'well done,  that's great' etc when I told Debbie she was so excited for me, saying she was so proud of me and how amazing it was that I'd got in. It made me feel so special.

She was my friend, my sister, my advisor, my best friend and I adore her. I have so many memories and in every one she had a smile. She saw the positive in every person and every situation. A rare and unique quality that she shared with her soul mate Fraz.
